# TestFrameWork
I am building a quick framework to test different aspects of OpenGL where each class is a different test.

This was originally part of a challenge from Cherno's OpenGL series before I entered school. But I really didn't understand how to solve the problem and had to move to the next tutorial to find out the solution. Now I am backtracking and going to try and try to solve the issues that Cherno solved in my own way and try and also just create more tests for the framework to use so I can better understand how OpenGL and C++ work to solidify a couple of concepts in my mind such as smart pointers, different methods for rendering multiple objects, maybe some other tests. It will also be a good tool to create to try and quickly create frameworks to understand OpenGL better without starting a whole new project to test out the concept quickly and easily.

# Current State
This is the starting point and this application was 1st written before I had solved the problem of creating a menu for multiple tests. I already solved this problem and I plan on solving this time on my own. I might spend some more time on this trying to learn the imGui library... But let's just see how far can get for now.
